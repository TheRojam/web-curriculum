Web Curriculum
==============

Web curriculum is a simple html based Curriculum Vitae you can edit with your personal details and put online.

####History
I initially started developing this project because i wanted to submit a nice and elegant Cover Letter for some amazing development job position. Then i realized it may be useful to someone else. :)

####Components
To start writing your own web curriculum, edit the following files:

+ CoverLetter.html
+ Curriculum.html (Still developing)

####Technology
This project is based on the Twitter [Bootstrap](http://twitter.com) framework.
